# NoSQL Social Network API

## Task


Your Challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript `Date` object to format timestamps.
